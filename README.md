# EPSS Self-Assessment (v1 structure)

See docs/Deployment\_Guide.md



## Install quickstart



Create DB \& import sql/install.sql



Update creds/BASE\_URL in /config.php



Drop AdminLTE 3.2 into /public/vendor/adminlte (and Font Awesome into /public/vendor/fontawesome)



Ensure /public/uploads is writable



Login: admin / admin123 → change immediately in Admin → Users



If you want me to also ship a MySQL dump with data or fold in any exact EPSS v1 labels/screens you prefer, say the word and I’ll package that too.
